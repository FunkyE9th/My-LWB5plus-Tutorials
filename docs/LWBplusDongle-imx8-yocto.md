# LWB5+ Dongle i.MX 8M Plus Yocto Integration



 This tutorial will show you how to integrate the LWB5+ Dongle into an i.MX 8M Plus Yocto platform.

1. Required Tools

   - LWB5+ Dongle (Part No. 450-00127 )
   - i.MX 8M Plus EVK (Part No. 8MPLUSLPD4-EVK)
     - Linux PC with Yocto Build Environment. As a prerequisite, we are going to assume that you know how to setup a Yocto build environment. This is covered well on NXP documentation (see i.MX_Yocto_Project_User's_Guide.pdf Rev. L5.4.70_2.3.0 â€” 31 December 2020); so we will not cover it here. We will focus on how to add Laird Connectivity's external layer into a Yocto build.

2. Setup

   We will flash our image into a micro SD card. If you prefer, you can use the onboard eMMC instead of an SD card. The LWB5+ Dongle will plug into J7. Power will be applied via J5, and J23 will be used to connect to a serial terminal (115200, N, 8, 1) . If the build works, the drivers will automatically load on power up. We will the connect to an AP and do a ping to demonstrate the WiFi works. For Bluetooth, we will do a scan to show devices that are discoverable or advertising.
